# COVID-19 Deaths and Population Analysis in England

## Overview

This project provides a detailed statistical analysis of COVID-19 deaths in England. It explores the relationship between demographic and health-related variables, using methods such as correlation analysis, linear regression, and hypothesis testing. The analysis uncovers how different factors (e.g., age distribution, gender, health conditions) influence population dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Installation

To run this project, you need R and the following packages installed:



```install.packages("ggplot2")```
```install.packages("corrplot")```
```install.packages("car")```
```install.packages("ppcor")```
```install.packages("lmtest")```
```install.packages("RcmdrMisc")```

## Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-population-analysis.git`

## Usage
After cloning the repository and installing the required R packages, you can run the scripts for the analysis. Here's how:

1. Load the dataset using the provided data.csv.
2. Run analysis_script.R to perform the analysis, which includes correlation tests, regression models, and visualizations.
To run the analysis script, use:

`source("analysis_script.R")`
This will generate plots and statistical outputs saved in the plots/ and results/ directories.

## Data
The dataset includes the following key variables:

`chPer`: Percentage of children
`tePer`: Percentage of teenagers
`aduPer`: Percentage of adults
`mPer`: Percentage of males
`vGHealth`: Very good health status
`gHealth`: Good health status
`nHealth`: Neutral health status
`bHealth`: Bad health status
`total_P`: Total population affected by COVID-19

## Methodology
This project follows these main analysis steps:

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize distributions using histograms and box plots.
- Correlation Analysis: Perform Spearman correlation to examine relationships between variables.
- Regression Models: Build linear regression models to predict COVID-19 deaths based on demographic and health factors.
- Model Selection: Use stepwise regression and ANOVA to select the best models.
- Visualization: Plot data distributions, model fits, and residuals.


Copy code
# Linear regression model
`model <- lm(total_P ~ chPer + aduPer + mPer + bHealth, data = co)`
`summary(model)`

# Visualizing the model fit
`plot(model$fitted.values, model$residuals,`
     `xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals")`
`abline(h = 0, col = "red")`

## Results
Key findings include:

- Positive correlation between COVID-19 deaths and the percentage of children, females, and bad health conditions.
- Linear regression models show that bad health (bHealth) is a significant predictor of COVID-19 deaths.
- The final model explains approximately 12.11% of the variance in the total population affected by COVID-19.
